Files and Descriptions:

For the purposes of this project, the following files were used:

X_test.txt
This file contains the measurements for the activities in the test dataset
X_train.txt
This file contains the measurements for the activities in the train dataset
subject_test.txt
This file contains the codes for the corresponding subjects who were included in the test dataset
subject_train.txt
This file contains the codes for the corresponding subjects who were included in the train dataset
y_test.txt
This file contains the activity codes that each subject performed for measurement in the test dataset
y_train.txt
This file contains the activity codes that each subject performed for measurement in the train dataset
activity_labels.txt
This file contains the descriptions of each activity corresponding to the activity codes in the y_test.txt and y_train.txt files
features.txt
This file contains the names of each activity measured and recorded in the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files
Dataset attributes

The entire dataset contains 564 columns (attributes) with 10299 observations (rows)

The subset of attributes contains 82 columns (attributes)

Analysis

Following are the steps to analysis of this data

Train Data

Read X_train.txt, join the dataset with the features.txt dataset to create a dataset with column names
Join the y_train.txt dataset
Match the activity codes of the y_train.txt file with the descriptions in the activity_labels.txt file and add those to the dataset
This introduces three new tidy columns to the X_train.txt dataset
subject_ID (integer)
activity_code(integer)
activity (string)
Test Data

Do the same for the test data as was done for the train data
Joining and subsetting datasets

Join the test and train datasets
Subset the datasets by removing all columns (attributes) that do not contain mean or standard deviation data
Rename the columns with their appropriate attribute names
Create a new dataset and store the average values for each attribute per subject per activity
Write the data to a file.
Attributes

Following are the attributes of the final tidy dataset
